This is my First Full stack app use MERN stack.
about the website.
you can register and put your recipe inside it and all people can see it 
about the recipe:
you can add
title
ingredients
instructions
and img for the recipe.

about sign in / register:
i used Authentication and Authorization. you must sign in to do the thing above
so if you are not login you can't add recipe or click on (My Recipe) you just see the other recipes 

about database:
every passward is crypted in the website so no one can see your password becuse the bcryptjs package ( const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);)
